SpeechJammer
============

SpeechJammer inhibits speech on the user, thanks to the Delayed Auditory Feedback effect. To put it briefly, the effect occurs when you hear your own voice at a slight delay. Many people tend to start mumbling, and therefore "jamming" speech. Works best if you try to read something!
